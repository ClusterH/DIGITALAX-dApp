      <b>PODE and the Player Creator Portal | The Field Testers and Digital Evaluators
      </b>
      <br><br>
      The PODE Player-Creator-Portal was set forth as a platform and instant plug-in ecosystem for independent developers to be able to gain access to a concentrated Field testing group: the PODE holders. Currently, there is no instant distribution platform for small, independent or just launching/starting out developers within the gaming, VR, 3D industry. <b>There is no way for them to be able to showcase their content in a meaningful way</b> i.e. have it so it actually gets put in front of a group that will both actively engage with and evaluate it.<br><br>
      <b>Creators (Not just Studios, but Independents) will have direct access to provide content for Players, interact with Players through the P-C-P.</b><br><br>

      <b>This is the PLAYER-CREATOR ECONOMY.</b>

      PODE Holders currently hold the access keys to this ecosystem and portal. They are the field testers and the digital evaluators. PODE is an ERC-721 NFT that is wallet locked. It is non-transferrable for a specific purpose, and that purpose is to bridge a digital economic gap where the PODE holders are one of the core ecosystem participants and have their unique digital ownership attached to this, gaining the prestige of having being intrinsically part of solving one of the most fundamental problems of digital asset valuation in an inevitably growing digitally denominated world, environment and life.
      <br><br>
      For small independent developers, finding a dedicated pre-launch, BETA-testing platform is ultimately non-existent. And, even if they can find something, getting something actually valuable out of it is another story.
      <br><br>
      Using our Asset Valuation Mechanism, the PODE holders provide the Creators, within the P-C-P, with a <b>universal natively digital evaluation of their content.</b> This is a level up tool for Creators, helping them to reach a wider audience and exposure faster, and enter a cut-throat market at Stage 1, rather than Stage 0 â€” an apprenticeship platform for the gaming ecosystem.
      <br><br>
      PODE Holders are providing a decentralised concentration and focus for the independent developers and creators to grow, gain exposure and providing a framework for players to better discover, better transparently engage and make distinctions.
      <br><br>
      The P-C-P will also grow into a content ecosystem and platform for identifying new mods, indie developers whose content is suitable to be integrated into ESPA for Casual Esports. PODE holders will be able to vote on who is #ESPAREADY, where their assessments and valuations will have direct influence on determining which difficulty level category the content is set for, and so the fair winning distributions to players against other content.
