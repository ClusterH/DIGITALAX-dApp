    <h3 class="subtitle">DASH for Cross-Digital Realms, the Metaverse </h3>
    In 1971 Herbert Simon stated, "A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently."
    <br><br>
    As the Creator economy continues to scale in both opportunity, market share and increased potentiality, the demand for a more effective realisation of creative intent has reached critical mass to a point where it can no longer be avoided. The mirror between how this intent plays out for creators on a human level and for computational execution on an information level is becoming increasingly cross-stitched. The nature of these operations at the file level, level of bits and level of humanity are crossing the threshold of and directly impacting the relationship between the personal and digital.
    <br><br>
    This personal-digital relationship is in immense need of a more effective re-arrangement and attention capital reallocation. Natively digital valuation mechanisms that are able to provide a clear roadmap for Creators so that they can productively evaluate and make conclusions on what tools and applications are able to actively address key pain points across their general lack of resource, time, financing and support do not currently exist. The greater burden that this absence causes stretches far deeper than just the frustration spoken by Creators on a day-to-day basis, rather, it continues to increase the length of the distance between theory and practice— and so feeding into the detrimental cycle of over-optimising in the wrong direction and reinforcing opaque mechanisms over which the Creators have zero control.
    <br><br>
    The DASH architecture addresses the core of the information optimisation and coordination problem through granting the Creator the ability to maintain control throughout the entirety of their creative and technical pipeline process. In our previous file format revisions we focused strongly on both the technical and business means as to how we are achieving this. For this most recent revision, we are emphasising our focus on the Creator, and in a timely fashion, diving deeper into the pitfalls within today’s creative economy and the negative impact that this so has on a Creator’s life and experience.
    <br><br>
    We too are Creators and so have always directly embedded our understanding and the needs of the creative side and Creators at the core. DASH is not a simple engineering process or interface.
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Adhering to Fidelity</h3>
    The Transformation Set that DASH employs for translating a source file for deployment into the application environment incorporates considerate logic at each transform pass. This customised technical approach, layered with complimentary business logic, effectively frames creativity into a coherent structure in order to up the quality as well as the cadence of the Creators interaction with a system that maintains a much higher fidelity to their actual objectives— optimising the delivery of their creative intent from the information layer into the human/personal layer.
    <br><br>
    For other systems, the Creator is not afforded the same level of support. Creating good content is hard and there is no one meaningful place for a Creator to go in order to overcome the functional difficulties that they experience throughout their pipeline; from spending absurd amounts of money on cloud rendering in order to adhere to timelines, only for artefacts to show, to overcoming technically absurd blocking points within the modelling applications themselves that are often created out of information slippage at the file layer.
    <br><br>
    This fundamental mismatch in the underlying metaphor set contradicts the constant and repetitive mantra for the ultimate culmination of creativity— cross digital realms for a seamless metaverse. Thus, the creative economy (made up of people, platforms, marketplaces and tools) is not able to inherently support the democratization of creative expression and entrepreneurship that is required in order to further empower an independent class to either start or continue to make a living off of their passionate expertise.
    <br><br>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Interoperability as a Core Feature</h3>
    The interoperability problem stands in the way of broader adoption of both the Creator’s scalability to produce work and also generate more value out of it. For too long, interoperability has been considered as an additional feature to a product or service, at the both digital and human layers, rather than a core. This mindset has also caused ripple effects through the broader creative-tech communities and helped establish strong walled gardens for some of the most ubiquitous information interfaces that we interact with today; twitter, facebook, instagram. To be even more specific, the 3D FBX file, one of the most widely used files for transferring information between application environments and game engines, too sits behind a multi-layered encryption protocol, and hence one of the core reasons why interoperability from such a bit layer has never been able to have been properly enhanced and further optimised upon.
    <br><br>
    DASH sets to establish a baseline of interoperable interfaces that anyone, including labelled “competitors”, can leverage off of, in order to actively succeed through previous limitations of agency that Creators were forced to adhere to within the services that were supposed to serve them, and also remove artificial ceilings on innovation in the current market, which is dominated by monopolists. If we are going to bust open the castle walls with the proverbial antitrust dragon, then we must install the right tools in order to reduce any possible Creator carnage.
    <br><br>
    DASH’s OS Community Incentive Network further sets this into action through actively programming into the core architecture a staking mechanism so that Creators can engage directly with the engineering layers of the file format. This mandates interoperability and collaborative delegation, whilst also effectively hedging for the ever-changing creative engineering landscape. No matter how much engineers and designers alike strain their imaginations, they can never fully plan for the interoperability needs of all future use cases, technologies, and circumstances— DASH incentivises the maintenance of a contemporary and upgradeable transformation set, where the users have the control.
    <br><br>
    A tokenized file format engineering architecture allows for further root problems and challenges to be simultaneously addressed for Creators, particularly in the sense of employing a deliberately designed system that doesn’t just financially reward the more affluent Creators, but rather levels the playing field so that content creation can be carried out across all creative verticals and provide upward mobility so that every Creator has the ability for achieving financial security, learnings and growth. This also more liberally licenses the growth of a self-governing ecosystem that collectively decides on the “how” for value and content transfer, without the nasty gatekeeping surprises we’ve seen from other platforms. The collaborative reinforcement here is critical for bridging and differentiating an open source community from development into the business domain that aims in the correct direction for ensuring the full exchange of information.
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="subtitle">The Engines and Applications (3D)</h3>
    As a further point to the Creator’s experience, and of high relevance for DASH and what we have set out to achieve— 3D modeling software is one of the most frustrating creative application environments simply  because it is very unlike any other class of software that most people commonly use, and also, heuristic parallels to the real world are incredibly slim.
    <br><br>
    This thus causes further pain in the creative process, whereby it is incredibly difficult to lead users into a new class of activity when their intuitive base is still not sound. Game engines and application programs today only further add to this confusion and “bootstrap into a new paradigm” approach. For example, opening a 3D CAD file in another system i.e. not where the file was originally designed, results in inconsistencies across the model, broken geometry and so incredible loss to the design intent. The ability to seamlessly exchange these various CAD formats directly impacts a creative project’s schedule, where visuals have to be sacrificed against time.
    <br><br>
    As 3D advances, the models have adapted to encompass more rich data across material information, styling, annotations etc., which are in fact valuable across the whole life cycle of the product, however, the complexity still has no strong underlying infrastructure to be able to rely on and maintain horizontal compatibility with. Thus, it only has led to an unscalable architecture that cannot support the richness of the original information, causing commonly resulting geometric errors, tolerance issues and loss of metadata associated with the design. The quality or richness of existing 3D models then also depends on the number of times it was exchanged or converted— where the final model becomes limited to the quality and precision of the least accurate system in the translation chain. Hence, closed proprietary exchange file formats are encouraged over community incentivised open sourced engineering.
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Summing Up</h3>
    All of these examples serve to illustrate how difficult it is for Creators to navigate the different platforms and make a living, often finding themselves powerless to effect change. These difficulties often lead Creators to look elsewhere for sources of revenue, leaving their passionate expertise in pursuit of something within a normal societal corporate framework. DASH ensures Creators can engage in a process that is honest to their artistic mode of creation and so uncompromising on creative integrity.
