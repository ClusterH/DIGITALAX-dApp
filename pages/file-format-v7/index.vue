    At present, container ships sit in waters outside of ports for days.
    <br><br>
    Business critical information delays leave otherwise liquid value stagnant in similarly obstructed pools.
    <br><br>
    Abstract containers of value in the form of Non Fungible Tokens are upending creator monetization in poorly
    understood ways.
    <br><br>
    It may not be obvious, but this context is why cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomic thinking are truly interesting.
    Yet, almost all of the explanations for why crypto is necessary are total hogwash — they’re just nonsense. They
    refer to a collection of speculative, cultural and technical factors, but don’t refer to the underlying scientific
    and mathematical factors which all of this bedrocks onto.

      Light Speed Delay
    </h3>
    The Speed of Light is often used as a reference to the limit on how fast anything in the universe can go. Well
    actually, this is misleading. The Speed of Light is unfortunately quite slow. In fact, it is so slow relative to
    modern computing devices that it creates a simple way to reconceive relationships to time and space in completely
    revolutionary ways. Fundamentally, it is impossible for all of the computers in our world to agree about when,
    where, and what is actually real. Why? Because they are all separated from each other by light speed delay.
    <br><br>
    This delay can be quite big. Between London and Australia, light speed delay translates to around a million or more
    transactions per second, in modern processing systems, not getting from where they are to where they are meant to be
    in a timely and effective manner. There is no way to circumnavigate this through physics, math, money, or
    administrative decree — closer synchronisation is simply not permitted by the base laws of physical realty.
    <br><br>
    For commercial activity, the friction caused by this inability to synchronise is corrosive. The fact that disputes
    in computing transactions arise at such large scales is inevitable, as we await signal propagation to acknowledge
    and confirm agreement on what, where, and when a deal, a product, or a communicated concept, is or isn’t as it
    claims to be. This lag in verifiable trust cascades throughout all information systems, substantially capping global
    trade in a way that is directly translatable to the limits imposed by the Speed of Light.
    <br><br>
    It may not be clear to all how this also opens the door to novel arbitrage opportunities. What is even less clear in
    an already opaque process, is the essential role that creative works, like gaming or scene based content, play in
    the flow of service and business value, particularly in the relationship between game and 3D software engines and
    rich media file formats.
    <br><br>
    The objects, scenes, and content experiences made in 3D creative engines are in and of themselves chokepoints in the
    global flow of value, like the Straights of Malacca or Suez Canal in global shipping. Just as GPS navigates light
    speed delay to unlock a Cambrian explosion in commercial value, the proper triangulation of 3D engine, information
    design, and file format optimization friction will bring a rush of liquidity to markets and users who don’t yet
    realize what is missing.
    <br><br>
    Why is this a hard problem to see? Because we have all become numb to accepting current practices as they are and
    are content in trusting that conventional approaches to optimisation, even if they are going in the wrong direction,
    will somehow deliver what is possible, desirable, and required.
    <br><br>
    We have seen moments in history like this before. Most notably in recent memory when Steve Jobs first unleashed the
    iPhone into our world. These are watershed events, delivering mass transformation of commercial, creative and
    consumer behavior alike. To be clear, this is the triangulation that DASH resolves and serves. Our file format
    architecture can not be achieved via some technical gimmick, or through a “go away and build in a cave” product
    development process. We innovate from a commercial perspective so that technical potential can be translated into
    broad based financial incentives, unlocking a virtuous cycle in how creativity, economic activity, and
    infrastructure development serve each other.

      Mechanism Design
    </h3>
    Often described as the flipside of game theory, mechanism design is the crafting of protocols or architectures that
    incentivize rational actors to behave in socially desirable ways. It starts by defining desirable outcomes and
    working backwards to create a game that incentivizes players towards those outcomes – whereas in game theory we take
    the game as a given and evaluate the outcomes instead.
    <br><br>
    In short, mechanism design allows us to embed cryptoeconomic thinking into the information optimisation layer for
    more desirable commercial, creative and consumer outcomes.
    <br><br>
    Cryptoeconomics is the field of study and practice that brings cryptography and economic incentives into the design
    process of antifragile commercial networks and applications. Crypto protocols, like Bitcoin and Ethereum for
    example, succeed because they incorporate cryptoeconomics into the core of how they achieve social consensus and
    coordination. Not consequentially, as many believe, because of the speculative, cultural and technical breakthroughs
    they also represent.
    <br><br>
    The ultimate threadline of cryptoeconomics is to transport cryptoeconomic incentives into everything — transactions,
    computation, storage, predictive capacity, social mobility, and the exercise of power at the decentralized edges in
    all networks of human activity and exchange.
    <br><br>
    The mechanism and cryptoeconomic design of DASH facilitates the transfer of value between the software applications,
    where meaningful information representing commercial products is constructed, and radically expansive towards the
    range of problems to which economic incentives can successfully be applied.
    <br><br>
    Let's review how this works from a more technical perspective:
    <br><br>
    We start with an evaluative estimate, which comprehensively informs the Creator of the potential cost & pain
    reduction they stand to gain when transforming their 3D model through our process. This happens before deployment
    into the intended application environment.
    <br><br>
    The requirements of a particular Creator are met through selected adjustments to low, medium, high and custom
    parameters. They are then presented with a set of uniquely personalised transform levels to choose from. The creator
    is guided through a narrowing scope to reach an “optimal” outcome for their needs.
    <br><br>
    This is directly linked to the native cryptoeconomic incentive system required for the Creator to fuel and implement
    the transformation function. The Creator’s preferences are taken in by the system and then strategically
    incorporated within the broader technical mechanisms to maximize their objective under an optimally guided set of
    constraints.
    <br><br>
    Here, Creators are intentionally incentivised to behave based upon their internal decision process without the need
    to verify whether they are indeed “rational agents”, leading to more socially desired outcomes for the whole system.
    These outcomes are further exercised extrinsically through the inclusion of the “custom” option throughout this
    estimate flow. Here, an embedded Open Source community incentive network translates individuals’ utility needs into
    actionable functions. The output of the decision trees feeding those functions contribute to the capture of
    externalities that these individuals’ actions imbue in the system through a staking, slashing, burning and yield
    mechanism for good actor validation and promotion— allowing researchers, developers and optimists alike to
    contribute new, upgradeable models to be used in the Transformation Set and grouped under this “custom” category.
    <br><br>
    Those that authentically contribute are able to actively gain yield from their staked crypto, whilst actors with bad
    intentions are slashed, either totally or in-part. By methodically introducing economic trade-offs against work put
    in, the fault tolerance that comes with the assumption of the honest majority model is accounted for. Further, DASH
    also defends against these assumptions through applying a GAN as a stability analyser. The GAN randomly simulates
    the models at no additional cost, where here if negative unintentional anomalies are identified, the staked amount
    is slashed in-part and provided back to the network.
    <br><br>
    Thus, DASH prioritises a human-centered interdisciplinary development approach that, through an ecosystem interlaced
    with open source, recognizes data scientists as creative problem solvers. Seamless information transfer is what
    underpins true creative flourishing and economic growth in native digital realms. We’re not suggesting that the
    disciplines of development and design merge without consideration, but rather that if optimists work together and
    learn each other’s art they will produce better outcomes— our crypto economic mechanism design incentivises this
    point precisely, transforming file format engineering from what a certain Silicon Valley legend once described as
    slices of cold dead fish on a plate (in other words, a lifeless and unrelatable abstract technical endeavour) to a
    sophisticated game-changer for any creator, commercial venture, or end consumer ready to finally reach their desired
    destination.
